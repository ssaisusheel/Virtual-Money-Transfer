# Virtual-Money-Transfer
A Stand-alone java application which acts as a demo for the idea of making online payment transfers

The main idea of this project is to implement a secured software application for the shopping malls which allows the e-transactions without the use of any credit/debit cards, my applications allows to perform the payments virtually without help of any cards. For security reasons, each time the customer performs a transaction a fresh and new session password is generated using which he/she can make the payments.
